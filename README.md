<h1 align="left">👋 Hi there</h1>

<p>
I’m <b>Anubhav Singh Pathania</b>, an MCA student and aspiring Data Scientist with a strong interest in
machine learning, data analysis, and AI-driven systems.
I enjoy working on real-world problems using structured ML pipelines, clean engineering practices,
and modern AI tools.

## 🚀 Expertise

I work primarily on applied machine learning and data-centric problem solving.  
My experience includes building end-to-end ML workflows — from data preprocessing and feature engineering
to model evaluation and deployment-ready pipelines.

I am particularly interested in:
- Translating raw data into meaningful insights
- Designing scalable and maintainable ML solutions
- Exploring NLP, RAG-based systems, and applied AI use cases

Alongside academics, I actively build projects to strengthen my understanding of practical machine learning
and software engineering fundamentals.
